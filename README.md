# Robot_path_planning
Robot path planning in static and dynamic environment (GSA, artificial potential field, QL, DDQL)  
1) GSA.py  
Use Gravitational Search Algorithm to path planning with static obstacles.  
2) potential field2.py  
Example path planning using artificial potential field algorithm in dynamic environment.
3) QL_path.py  
Use Q-learning to path plannin in dynamic environment.  
Observation: terget and two dynamic obstacles.  
4) DQN_PATH.py  
Create DDQN to path planning in dynamic environment.  
WARNING!!!
Stabilization alghorithm:  
- two Q matrix,  
- use Hubert loss function,  
- use the range of reward values [0, 1]
